# check whether a theory is categorical in a certain finite power

# a few ways to proceed:
#
# - given a theory and cardinality n, output a new TPTP file
# representing the problem of showing that the theory is categorical
#
# - given a theory and a model of it, output a new TPTP file
# representing the problem of showing that any model of the theory is
# isomorphic to the given one

# not only construct the problem, but try to solve it.  (I guess it is
# a graph isomorphism problem.)
